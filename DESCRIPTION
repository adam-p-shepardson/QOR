Description: Matching point geometries (e.g., voter locations) to polygon geometries (e.g., school districts) 
    using spatial intersections and distances. The package implements the "Query, Overlay, Recover" (QOR) method from CITE, 
    which is a three-step process to identify which voters live in which school districts. QOR may be generalizable to
    other sets of point and polygon geometries, although the package is currently designed for education research applications.
